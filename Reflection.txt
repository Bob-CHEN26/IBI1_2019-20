This is a reflective report in IBI_2019-20.
During this course, we have learned UNIX systems, version-control systems and python for the first time, which are basic and significant tools in biological researches. Most of practical centres on writing programs in python, and it is not only the best way to review the weekly knowledge, but also to cultivate my mind on program structure, for example nested loop. Since I have learned Visual Basic before and there are many similarities in codes between python and Visual Basic, I am receptive to the new knowledge taught in this semester. Also, I am surprised to find that many kinds of documents can be dealt with by python, such as .XML, .txt, .xlsx, .csv, etc. Though we just learn to search and revise information, I believe more functions will be taught in further study.
In my opinion, game of 24 points is the most difficult task in this semester. Since I can make a logic flow of how to achieve the outcome, there are still some codes I cannot write with poor knowledge, so I chose to look for online references and make a discussion with other students. With some imported libraries, I spent much time and effort and successfully finished it at last.
When writing a program, the last thing I want to see is “Error”. I am always confident with my programming skills since I have a clear logic flow. However, it cannot be denied that there always exist errors in each practice, so I improve my patience to find out and fix errors after this semester’s practical, which benefits my future biological studies.
